A new shell interpreter. (A lot of new bugs in it)
-Learned how to use exec and fork
-I am killing the parent process somewhere, need to look for it can't find it.
-file descriptors are a little confusing to work with first, but got used to them.


TODO
  NOT KILL THE PARENT PROCESS
  make the Shell prompt look better (more colorful)
  add file redirectors (>> and <<)
  Piping works fine (for now)
